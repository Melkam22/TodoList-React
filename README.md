This is a simple 'todo-list application' developed using react. With this app we can list down things that we want to do during the day or we can put too list of things we want to buy before heading to the supermarket. One can write and delete elements from the list he had written. It is responsive, and it is planned to be improved with the aim of linking it to the data base inorder to save datas permanently.
